        <p> Situated on Smart Island along Watamu beach. The Smart Resort Island is sorrounded by indigenous forest and offers magnificent sea views. 
            The resort has three outdoor pools and spa.</p>
        <p>Whether you're looking for and <span class="important">all-inclusive resort</span> to handle everything from food, lodging, drinks and amenties or a <span class="important">romantic resort</span> primed to
            give you and your significant other the spicy experience you've both have been waiting for, there's a resort for your vacation needs.</p>
        <p> Perhaps you want to bring the whole family and need a kids club or, when necesary, an adults-only zone.</p>
        <p>Looking to be in a water? There are resorts perfectly situated beachside and, for the more adventurous, overwater bungalows, where the water sings you to sleep. 
             Some resorts are more affordable than others, but at the end of the day, this is vacation-live (and spend) a little. </p>
